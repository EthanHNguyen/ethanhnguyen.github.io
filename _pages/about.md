Hey! I'm a software engineer with interests in open source software, operating systems, distributed systems, and machine learning. I work as a software engineer at [Capital One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One) on an internal Jupyter-like platform that enables ~8,000 analysts, data scientists, and engineers to train machine learning models from within a browser.  

I graduated [Vanderbilt University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2023, and I am continuing my education part-time at [Georgia Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Online_Master_of_Science_in_Computer_Science) towards a Master's degree. In college, I worked as a research assistant and [published](https://ethanhn.com/publications/) a couple papers in medical computer vision.
