Welcome to my blog! Thanks for stopping by. I'm Ethan Nguyen. I recently graduated Vanderbilt University with a Bachelor's of Science (Computer Science) in May 2023. Since then, I have been working as a full-time software engineer at Capital One building a brand new system to decide credit card applications. Previously, each credit card product had their own application system but this work will combine all products onto one platform. I'm also continuing my education as a part-time remote student at Georgia Tech to obtain a Master's of Science (Computer Science). My professional interests span distributed systems and machine learning.

In my free time, I love spending time outdoors running, hiking, and cycling.
