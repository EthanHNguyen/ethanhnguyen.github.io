Welcome! I’m a dedicated software engineer with deep expertise in distributed systems, machine learning, and cloud architecture. Currently, I’m leading the design and development of an innovative Jupyter Notebook-based platform at Capital One, which empowers over 7,500 internal users—including analysts, data scientists, and engineers—to autonomously train models for critical banking functions such as fraud detection, customer segmentation, and risk management. This platform processes petabytes of data each week and handles billions of data points, all while supporting a cloud spend of approximately $40 million annually. By leveraging technologies like Go, Argo CI/CD, Argo Workflows, and Kubernetes, I ensure scalability, reliability, and efficient deployment, driving automation and enhancing workflows across teams.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University, where I developed new machine learning algorithms, authored two first-author peer-reviewed papers, and presented my research at ML conferences. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and hold an AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification, specializing in the design and implementation of scalable, high-performance cloud solutions.

Earlier in my career, I played a key role in building a credit application engine that launched multiple new credit card brands at Capital One. I also led the migration of high-transaction microservices to AWS Fargate, driving significant operational cost savings.

I’m passionate about tackling complex business challenges with scalable, reliable systems and thrive in collaborative environments where innovation and technical excellence can drive impactful results. Feel free to explore my work and connect!
