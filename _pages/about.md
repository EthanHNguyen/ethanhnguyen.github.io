Welcome to my professional website! I'm a passionate software engineer with expertise in distributed systems, machine learning, and cloud architecture. Currently, I design and develop a cutting-edge Jupyter Notebook-based platform that enables over 7,500 internal users at Capital One — including analysts, data scientists, and engineers — to autonomously train models for critical banking functions like fraud detection, customer segmentation, risk management, and more. The platform processes petabytes of data weekly, built on AWS, and handles billions of data points with a cloud spend of approximately $40 million annually. Leveraging Go, Argo CI/CD, Argo Workflows, and Kubernetes, I ensure scalability, reliability, and efficient deployment, streamlining workflows and enhancing automation across teams.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University, where I invented new machine learning algorithms, published two first-author peer-reviewed papers, and presented at ML conferences. I’m now pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and hold an AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification, specializing in designing and implementing high-performance, scalable cloud solutions.

Earlier in my career, I contributed to building a credit application engine that launched multiple new credit card brands at Capital One. I also led the migration of high-transaction microservices to Fargate, saving the company significant operational costs.

I’m passionate about solving complex business challenges with scalable, robust systems and love collaborating with talented teams to deliver impactful solutions in software engineering, machine learning, and cloud architecture. Feel free to explore my work and connect!
