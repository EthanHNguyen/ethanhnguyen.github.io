Welcome to my blog! Thanks for stopping by. I'm Ethan Nguyen. I am a (professional) software enthusiast.

I am a full-time software engineer at [Capital One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One) building a brand new system to decide credit card applications. I graduated Vanderbilt University with a Bachelor's of Science (Computer Science) in May 2023. Since then, I'm also continuing my education as a part-time remote student at Georgia Tech to obtain a Master's of Science (Computer Science) expected to graduate in 2026. I love working on distributed systems as well as tinkering with machine learning. On the ML front, I've [published](https://ethanhn.com/publications/) a couple papers in medical computer vision. 

In my free time, I love spending time outdoors running, hiking, and cycling.
