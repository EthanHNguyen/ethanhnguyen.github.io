I am a passionate software engineer specializing in distributed systems, machine learning, and cloud architecture. At Capital One, I design and develop critical components of an internal Jupyter-based platform that enables over 8,000 analysts, data scientists, and engineers to autonomously train models for key banking functions like fraud detection, customer segmentation, risk management, credit scoring, and loan pricing — using petabytes of data per week. Built on AWS, the platform processes billions of data points with an annual cloud spend of approximately $40 million. To ensure scalability, reliability, and efficient deployment, the platform utilizes Go, Argo CI/CD, Argo Workflows, and Kubernetes, streamlining workflows and enhancing automation across teams.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University and am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science through Georgia Tech. Additionally, I hold an AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification, which complements my expertise in designing and implementing scalable, high-performance cloud solutions.

Earlier in my career, I helped develop a credit application engine that launched five new credit cards at Capital One. As part of this effort, I built a test framework to automate a manual process, saving 1,000–2,000 hours annually. I also mentored three engineers, fostering their growth and improving team productivity.

With a passion for building scalable systems that solve complex business problems, I thrive on collaborating with teams to deliver innovative solutions in software engineering, machine learning, and cloud architecture.
