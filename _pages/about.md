I am a software engineer with a strong background in distributed systems and machine learning. Currently, I am contributing to an internal Jupyter-based platform at Capital One, where I help enable over 8,000 analysts, data scientists, and engineers to efficiently train machine learning models directly within their browsers.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science through Georgia Tech’s Online Master’s Program, further enhancing my expertise in the field.

During my undergraduate years, I worked as a research assistant and published several papers in the area of medical computer vision, blending my technical skills with a passion for impactful, real-world applications.

I am passionate about building scalable, high-performance systems that drive innovation and empower users, and I am always eager to collaborate on challenging, cutting-edge projects in the fields of software engineering and machine learning.
