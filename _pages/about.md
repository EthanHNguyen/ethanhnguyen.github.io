Hi! I'm Ethan, an aspiring machine learning engineer and entrepreneur. Currently, I am working at Capital One in their two-year rotational program (their Technology Development Program) and simutaneously studying for a Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. 

## Brief History
In June 2023, I graduated from Vanderbilt University summa cum laude with a B.S. in Computer Science. While I was there, I published two first-author machine learning papers, presented at a Medical AI conference in Singapore, and built a couple of full-stack web apps.

## Skills
* Languages: Python, C / C++
* ML Tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
* Databases: MongoDB, DynamoDB
* Web Development: React, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS
* Other tools: Git, Linux, Docker, AWS, Agile

## Future
I love learning new things everyday whether it is in my job, in class, reading papers, or browsing Twitter. I am optimistic that we can improve our communities through technology and business.
