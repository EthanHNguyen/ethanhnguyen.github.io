What is truth? Truth is information about reality. 

But how do you seek truth? My approach involves two fundamental steps: 1) Gather evidence. 2) Think for yourself.

In my opinion, this method is a decent way to seek truth — it’s the very way I navigate the complex landscape of understanding. It requires a delicate balance of evidence and independent thinking, echoing the scientist’s methodological approach.

However, there are alternative ways to seek truth.

One might choose to adopts the beliefs of others. However, have you stopped to consider why the “other” believes what they do? Perhaps, like us, they too have gathered some evidence and reflected on their experiences. 

Why do I use the term “seek” truth? I think it’s very hard to actually obtain truth; one can always dig deeper, asking “why?” or how?” on a topic. Our perspective and bias limit us, and some truths may elude empirical evidence, requiring a different type of validation. Don’t forget to consider your personal experience — they too play a crucial role.

These are my opinions on truth-seeking, closely aligning with critical thinking principles. Remaining open-minded and embracing new perspectives is crucial, recognizing that different approaches suit different contexts. I have to admit that these questions are complex and I’ve only begun to scratch the surface. 

Let’s delve deeper into the fascinating journey of seeking truth together. How do you determine good approaches to truth-seeking? What is truth?

P.S. Ironically, I ran this essay through OpenAI’s ChatGPT 3.5, incorporating its excellent critiques:

- the limitations of my own perspective and bias.
- the importance of different perspectives to approaching truth and the various contexts in which truth seeking occurs.
- the limitations of empirical evidence and the scientific method.
- the importance of personal experience and intuition.
- the tone and style of the essay.
