> All models are wrong, but some are useful. [1] 

I heard this quote today during a wonderful workshop on CyberSecurity Essentials by Caitlin Coffey. This aphorism (I just learned about this word) describes many facets in life. The most useful is how we think about our own knowledge. We we know is a model of the world. Be humble. Assume it is wrong but sometimes useful. Seek to learn everyday.
