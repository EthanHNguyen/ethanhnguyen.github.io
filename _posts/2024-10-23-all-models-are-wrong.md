> All models are wrong, but some are useful. [1] 

I heard this quote today during a wonderful workshop on CyberSecurity Essentials by one of my colleagues. This aphorism succintly describes how I think about my own knowledge. What I know is a model of the world. Be humble. Assume knowledge is wrong but useful. Seek to learn everyday.
