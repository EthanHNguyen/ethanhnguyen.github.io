If you're a nerd like me, you enjoy learning new things. What's are important things to learn? 

For me, I learned this week what makes me happy and it's changed the way I live. 

It all started with the realization that I could die today. Today could be my last day. I should spent my limited time on things I enjoy. With this realization in mind, learned what makes me happy. Coding, studying, running, socializing, hiking, giving ...

I used to believe that we are forced to pick and choose what we want in life. This week, I discovered I can have it all. Immersing myself in life has been me more productive, healthier, and a happier person. I learned don't wait to live tomorow. Live today while you still can.
