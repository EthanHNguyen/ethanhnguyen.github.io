One of my mentors is a Director of Software Engineering. We recently met during happy hours. I asked him, "What advice would you share with your kids?"

He encourages his kids to master 3 skills:

1. Communication 
2. Time management
3. Networking

These three skills are [force multipliers](https://ethanhn.com/posts/2024/10/23/synergy/) in whatever you do.
